#  About

Hi, I'm Shivam!

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo currently studying Systems Design Engineering.

When I'm not working out, cooking, or watching Netflix, I enjoy working on projects and exploring technology to see what I can create.

Often this means that I need to learn a new language, rethink the way I structure my code or learn about entirely new concepts. I document some of the things that I pick up along the way to help others that are as curious as I am.

My principal motivation is finding problems and inventing solutions. As much as I enjoy programming, this means that I like project management and design just as much. Anything that involves pushing the limits of what I know, especially related to technology, is sure to pique my interest.
