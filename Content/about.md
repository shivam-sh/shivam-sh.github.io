#  About

Hi, I'm Shivam!

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering.

When I'm not working out, cooking, or watching Netflix I enjoy working on projects to see just what I can create.

This often means that I need to learn a new language, rethink the way I structure my code, or learn about entirely new concepts. I document some of the things that I pick up along the way on my website to help others that are as curious as I am.

My main motivation is finding problems and inventing solutions. This means that as much as I emjoy programming, I like design and project management just as much.
